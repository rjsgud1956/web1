        <h2>1절</h2>
            <p>I do the same thing I told you<br>
            that I never would<br>
            I told you I'd change, even<br>
            when I knew I never could<br>
            I know that I can't find nobody else<br>
            as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay,<br>
            need you to stay, hey (Oh)<br>
            I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still<br>
            I realize the time that I wasted here<br>
            I feel like you can't feel the way I feel<br>
            Oh, I'll be fucked up<br>
            if you can't be right here<br>
            Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)<br>
            Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)<br>
            Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)<br>
            Oh, I'll be fucked up<br>
            if you can't be right here<br>
            I do the same thing I told you<br>
            that I never would<br>
            I told you I'd change,<br>
            even when I knew I never could<br>
            I know that I can't find nobody else<br>
            as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey</p>
        <h2>2절</h2>
            <p>I do the same thing I told you<br>
            that I never would<br>
            I told you I'd change,<br>
            even when I knew I never could<br>

            as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
            When I'm away from you,<br>
            I miss your touch (Ooh)<br>
            You're the reason I believe in love<br>
            It's been difficult for me to trust (Ooh)<br>
            And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up<br>
            Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded<br>
            'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed<br>
            And you know that I know<br>
            that I can't live without you<br>
            So, baby, stay<br>
            Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)<br>
            Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)<br>
            Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)<br>
            I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br>
            I do the same thing I told you<br>
            that I never would<br>
            I told you I'd change,<br>

            as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
            I do the same thing I told you<br>
            that I never would<br>
            I told you I'd change,<br>
            even when I knew I never could<br>
            I know that I can't find nobody else<br>
            as good as you<br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
            Woah-oh<br>
